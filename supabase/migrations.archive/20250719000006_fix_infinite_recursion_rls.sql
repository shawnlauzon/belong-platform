-- Fix infinite recursion in community_memberships RLS policy
-- We need to avoid querying community_memberships within its own policy

-- Drop the problematic policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Community members can view all memberships in their communities" ON community_memberships;

-- Create a policy that allows users to see memberships where they are either:
-- 1. The user being viewed (can always see yourself)
-- 2. An authenticated user viewing public membership data (we'll handle community filtering at the application level)
CREATE POLICY "Users can view community memberships" ON community_memberships
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (true);

-- Note: This is more permissive but avoids recursion. 
-- Community-specific filtering should be handled at the application level
-- through proper query construction rather than RLS policies.
