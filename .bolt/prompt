For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

The UI components should never make changes to the model or to the database. Components only emit events, and Features read these events to make model / supabase changes and then emit events when complete. The UI listens to events to make real-time changes.
