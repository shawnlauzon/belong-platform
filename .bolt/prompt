Use `pnpm install` to install dependencies.
Use `pnpm dev` to run dev build.

For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

Events Trigger Mutations - Never call mutations directly from UI components
Mutations Emit Completion Events - Use React Query's onSuccess/onError callbacks
Centralized Cache Invalidation - Event handlers coordinate React Query invalidation
Direct Cache Updates - For immediate feedback, use queryClient.setQueryData()

Always use pnpm commands instead of npm for this project.

When generating code that imports from @belongnetwork/* packages, always use the direct import path import { supabase } from '@belongnetwork/*' without including additional path segments like /config/supabase. The package exports are configured to expose these utilities directly from the root import.

All cross-package interfaces are defined only in the core package and imported from there as needed.
