# E2E Test Plan - Next Phase Documentation

## 📋 **Current Status & Next Steps**

### **✅ What's Complete (Phases 1-3):**
- **Phase 1**: Integration Test Infrastructure - Vitest, Supabase backend, test helpers ✅
- **Phase 2**: Service-Level Integration Tests - Auth, Communities, Resources, Events, Thanks, Messaging, Users ✅  
- **Phase 3**: Advanced Integration Tests - Multi-step workflows, cross-service tests, auth state synchronization ✅
- **Additional**: Build validation, package regression testing, test consolidation ✅

### **🎯 Next Phase: E2E Testing (Phases 4-5)**

**Phase 4: E2E Infrastructure Setup**
- **4A**: Install Playwright, create test app harness, configure cross-browser testing
- **4B**: Build React test application consuming @belongnetwork/platform with all major UI flows  
- **4C**: Page Object Models for authentication, communities, resources, events, and profile pages

**Phase 5: E2E User Flow Testing**
- **5A**: Core E2E User Flows - Test new user onboarding, authentication flows, and profile setup
- **5B**: Community E2E Flows - Test community discovery, joining, browsing, and member interactions
- **5C**: Content E2E Flows - Test resource creation, sharing, editing, and social interactions  
- **5D**: Social E2E Flows - Test thanks giving, messaging, event participation, and notification handling

### **🔑 Key Decisions Made:**

1. **Test App Foundation**: Use existing `tests/customer-webapp/` as base for E2E test application
2. **AuthGuard Testing**: Move redirect/navigation tests from integration to E2E (better suited for browser testing)
3. **Tool Stack**: Playwright for cross-browser E2E testing
4. **Testing Focus**: Real user workflows through actual UI components, not platform package internals
5. **Phases 6-7**: Marked as SKIPPED for platform-only package (no UI components to test)

```

### **🚀 When Resuming E2E Development:**

**Start with Phase 4A**: E2E Test Infrastructure Setup
1. Install Playwright in the project
2. Configure cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)  
3. Set up E2E test harness using existing customer-webapp as foundation
4. Create E2E-specific test utilities and helpers

**Integration → E2E Migration Notes:**
- AuthGuard behavior tests should be moved from integration to E2E
- Navigation and redirect testing better suited for real browser testing
- Customer-reported authentication bugs can be validated end-to-end

### **📊 Test Coverage Summary:**
- **Integration Tests**: 15 files covering all platform functionality with real Supabase backend
- **Build Validation**: Package structure, TypeScript definitions, consumer compatibility  
- **Auth State Testing**: Bug reproduction, timing analysis, cache invalidation
- **Cross-Service Tests**: Cache consistency, transaction integrity, concurrent operations
- **Package Regression**: API consistency, performance baselines, behavior validation

### **💡 E2E Test Strategy:**
- Focus on **user experience** rather than API functionality
- Test **complete workflows** from login to content creation to social interactions
- Validate **browser-specific behavior** like navigation, redirects, session persistence
- Ensure **cross-browser compatibility** for the platform package consumers
- Test **real-world scenarios** that integration tests cannot cover
